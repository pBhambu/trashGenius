        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic waste doesn’t disappear — it drifts. Currents carry billions of pieces of plastic
          across the globe, concentrating them in islands, gyres, and coastlines. Our interactive
          map turns complex ocean data into a clear, visual story that anyone can explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this tool, you can track how plastic pollution moves, where it accumulates, and how it
          affects marine environments. Whether you're a student, researcher, or someone who cares
          about the planet, this map helps you see the problem in a new way.

        <h2>How the Map Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our map uses real scientific models, ocean-current data, and environmental research to
          simulate the movement of plastic around the world.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow plastic as it travels through major ocean currents</li>
          <li>See hotspots with the highest concentration</li>
          <li>Understand seasonal and long-term patterns</li>
          <li>Explore how human activity affects different regions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is simple: make the invisible data behind ocean pollution visible and easy to
          understand.

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean. Much of it breaks into
          microplastics that are nearly impossible to clean up and affect everything from plankton to
          whales.
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding how plastic spreads, we can better design solutions — from smarter waste
          management to targeted cleanup efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project exists to educate, inspire action, and bring transparency to a global issue.
